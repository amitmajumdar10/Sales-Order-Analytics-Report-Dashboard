## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sales-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud environment-specific configurations:
```env
# Development Environment Configuration (Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud)
API_BASE_URL_DEV=https://your-dev-instance.demandware.net
CLIENT_ID_DEV=your_dev_client_id_here
AUTH_HEADER_DEV=Basic your_dev_auth_header_here

# Production Environment Configuration (Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud)
API_BASE_URL_PRD=https://your-prod-instance.demandware.net
CLIENT_ID_PRD=your_prod_client_id_here
AUTH_HEADER_PRD=Basic your_prod_auth_header_here

# Configurable Term Query Fields
# Define which fields should be available for filtering in the order search query
# Format: TERM_QUERY_FIELD_<FIELD_NAME>=<field_name_in_api>
# The status field is always included and cannot be disabled

# Order Type Field (c_smartOrderType) - Controls order type filtering (Prepaid/Postpaid)
TERM_QUERY_FIELD_ORDER_TYPE=c_smartOrderType
TERM_QUERY_FIELD_ORDER_TYPE_VALUES=Prepaid,Postpaid

# Additional configurable fields (uncomment and modify as needed):
# TERM_QUERY_FIELD_CUSTOMER_TYPE=c_customerType
# TERM_QUERY_FIELD_CUSTOMER_TYPE_VALUES=New,Returning,VIP,Premium

# TERM_QUERY_FIELD_CHANNEL=c_channel
# TERM_QUERY_FIELD_CHANNEL_VALUES=Online,Store,Mobile,Call Center,Partner

# TERM_QUERY_FIELD_REGION=c_region

## Key Features Explained

### Configurable Term Query Fields
The application supports dynamic filter fields that can be configured via environment variables without code changes:
- **Environment-Driven**: Fields are defined using `TERM_QUERY_FIELD_<NAME>=<api_field>` variables
- **Dropdown Values**: Field options populated from `TERM_QUERY_FIELD_<NAME>_VALUES=value1,value2,value3`
- **Dynamic UI**: Frontend automatically shows only configured fields with proper dropdown options
- **Required Status Filter**: Always includes status filter (`not_in: ["created", "failed"]`) regardless of configuration
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to add/remove fields per environment without touching application code
- **API Integration**: Uses Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud term_query structure for precise filtering

### In-Memory Caching
The application uses node-cache to implement intelligent caching of Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud API responses:
- **Cache Duration**: Responses are cached for 30 minutes (configurable)
- **Cache Keys**: Generated based on request parameters (environment, order type, date range, configurable fields)
- **Performance**: Subsequent identical requests return instantly from cache, reducing load on Commerce Cloud
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired entries every minute
- **Cache Management**: Built-in endpoints to monitor and clear cache when needed

### Automatic Pagination
The backend automatically handles pagination when the Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud API returns more than 200 orders, making multiple requests to fetch all data for the selected date range.

### Real-time Filtering
Orders are filtered client-side after fetching to provide instant results when changing payment methods, while maintaining server-side filtering for order types and date ranges.

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud API failures
- **Invalid Dates**: Validation of date range inputs  
- **No Data**: User-friendly messages when no orders match filters
- **Persistent UI**: Input controls remain accessible during error states

### Responsive Design
The dashboard is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Integration

This dashboard integrates directly with Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud APIs to provide custom analytics capabilities:

### API Integration
- Uses Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Order Search API (`/dw/shop/v24_5/order_search`)
- Supports both Development and Production Commerce Cloud instances
- Implements OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure API access
- Handles Commerce Cloud API rate limits through intelligent caching

### Relationship with CCAC
- **Complementary Tool**: This dashboard is designed to complement, not replace, CCAC (Reports and Dashboards)
- **Custom Analytics**: Provides specialized views and filtering options not available in standard CCAC reports
- **Real-time Data**: Offers near real-time order analysis with custom date ranges and filters
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Features interactive charts and KPIs tailored for specific business needs

### Use Cases
- Custom order analysis beyond standard CCAC capabilities
- Real-time monitoring of order trends and patterns
- Specialized filtering by payment methods and order types
- Cross-environment order data comparison (DEV vs PRD)

## Development

### Adding New Configurable Term Query Fields
1. **Add Environment Variables**: Define the field and its values in `.env`:
   ```env
   TERM_QUERY_FIELD_DEPARTMENT=c_department
   TERM_QUERY_FIELD_DEPARTMENT_VALUES=Electronics,Clothing,Books,Sports
   ```
2. **Restart Server**: No code changes needed - the field will automatically appear in the UI
3. **Field Mapping**: Update the `buildTermQueries` function in `server.js` if custom field mapping is needed

### Adding New Payment Methods
1. Add the new option to the frontend dropdown in `App.js`
2. The backend will automatically handle the new payment method ID

### Customizing Field Labels and Options
1. **Field Labels**: Modify the `fieldLabels` object in `/api/config/fields` endpoint
2. **Dropdown Options**: Update environment variables with comma-separated values
3. **Field Order**: Fields appear in the order they are processed (order_type first, then alphabetically)

### Customizing Charts
Charts are built with Chart.js and can be customized by modifying the chart configuration objects in `App.js`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend server won't start:**
- Check that the `.env` file exists in the `backend` directory
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Ensure port 3001 is not already in use

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Verify the backend is running on port 3001
- Check for CORS issues in browser console
- Ensure the API URL in `App.js` matches the backend port

**No data showing:**
- Check the date range (ensure it includes orders)
- Verify the selected filters aren't too restrictive
- Check browser console for API errors
- Try clearing the cache using `DELETE /api/cache/clear` if data seems stale

**Configurable fields not appearing:**
- Verify environment variables are properly set in `.env` file
- Ensure both `TERM_QUERY_FIELD_<NAME>` and `TERM_QUERY_FIELD_<NAME>_VALUES` are defined
- Check server console for field configuration warnings
- Restart the backend server after adding new environment variables
- Use `GET /api/config/fields` to verify field configuration

### Logs
- Backend logs are visible in the terminal running the backend server
- Frontend logs are available in the browser's developer console
