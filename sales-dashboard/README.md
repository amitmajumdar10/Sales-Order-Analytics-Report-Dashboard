## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sales-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with environment-specific configurations:
```env
# Development Environment Configuration
API_BASE_URL_DEV=https://dev-api.example.com
CLIENT_ID_DEV=dev_client_id_here
AUTH_HEADER_DEV=Basic dev_auth_header_here

# Production Environment Configuration
API_BASE_URL_PRD=https://prod-api.example.com
CLIENT_ID_PRD=prod_client_id_here
AUTH_HEADER_PRD=Basic prod_auth_header_here
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

This single command will start both the backend server (port 3001) and frontend development server (port 3000).

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/orders`
Fetches and processes order data based on filters. Responses are cached in-memory for 30 minutes to improve performance and reduce external API calls.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "startDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "endDate": "2025-01-31T23:59:59.999Z",
  "orderType": "Prepaid",
  "paymentMethod": "COD",
  "environment": "DEV"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "dailyMetrics": {
    "2025-01-01": {
      "orders": 150,
      "revenue": 45000,
      "units": 300
    }
  },
  "customerBreakdown": {
    "new": 75,
    "returning": 75,
    "registered": 100,
    "unregistered": 50
  },
  "kpis": {
    "totalOrders": 150,
    "totalRevenue": 45000,
    "totalUnits": 300,
    "avgOrderValue": 300,
    "avgUnitsPerTransaction": 2
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/cache/stats`
Returns cache statistics including total keys, cache hits/misses, and current cached keys.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "keys": 3,
    "hits": 15,
    "misses": 8,
    "ksize": 3,
    "vsize": 3
  },
  "totalKeys": 3,
  "keys": ["orders_DEV_Prepaid_2025-01-01_2025-01-31"],
  "message": "Cache statistics retrieved successfully"
}
```

### DELETE `/api/cache/clear`
Clears all cached entries.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Cache cleared successfully. Removed 3 entries.",
  "clearedKeys": 3
}
```

### DELETE `/api/cache/clear/:key`
Clears a specific cache entry by key.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Cache entry for key 'orders_DEV_Prepaid_2025-01-01_2025-01-31' cleared successfully.",
  "deleted": true

## Key Features Explained

### In-Memory Caching
The application uses node-cache to implement intelligent caching of API responses:
- **Cache Duration**: Responses are cached for 30 minutes (configurable)
- **Cache Keys**: Generated based on request parameters (environment, order type, date range)
- **Performance**: Subsequent identical requests return instantly from cache
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired entries every minute
- **Cache Management**: Built-in endpoints to monitor and clear cache when needed

### Automatic Pagination
The backend automatically handles pagination when the API returns more than 200 orders, making multiple requests to fetch all data for the selected date range.

### Real-time Filtering
Orders are filtered client-side after fetching to provide instant results when changing payment methods, while maintaining server-side filtering for order types and date ranges.

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Invalid Dates**: Validation of date range inputs  
- **No Data**: User-friendly messages when no orders match filters
- **Persistent UI**: Input controls remain accessible during error states

### Responsive Design
The dashboard is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Development

### Adding New Payment Methods
1. Add the new option to the frontend dropdown in `App.js`
2. The backend will automatically handle the new payment method ID

### Adding New Filters
1. Add state management in `App.js`
2. Update the API call to include the new parameter
3. Modify the backend to accept and process the new filter
4. Update the `processOrderData` function if needed

### Customizing Charts
Charts are built with Chart.js and can be customized by modifying the chart configuration objects in `App.js`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend server won't start:**
- Check that the `.env` file exists in the `backend` directory
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Ensure port 3001 is not already in use

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Verify the backend is running on port 3001
- Check for CORS issues in browser console
- Ensure the API URL in `App.js` matches the backend port

**No data showing:**
- Check the date range (ensure it includes orders)
- Verify the selected filters aren't too restrictive
- Check browser console for API errors
- Try clearing the cache using `DELETE /api/cache/clear` if data seems stale

### Logs
- Backend logs are visible in the terminal running the backend server
- Frontend logs are available in the browser's developer console
